Do you have a friend who upvotes themselves shamelessly? Remind them everytime they decide to do it with this simple bot. 

To setup auth on your own server rename the `auth.json.default` file to `auth.json` and insert your own application token where necessary. Do the same thing for the `config.json.default` file with the user to hate's information. New messages may be added via the reactions.messages field, be sure to include a `{nickname}` in every message that will be a placeholder for the hated user's discord nickname.
